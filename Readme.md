## Vim-HiCAD

A Vim plugin with syntax highlighting for the HiCAD Makro language.

Currently it can detect *.MAC files and do some highlighting.

-[] Get proper highlight of all possible numbers
-[] Highlight String and numerical Variables

I'm still a beginner with this very old language,
so there is possibly more.
Also there is a lot to learn in vim.
